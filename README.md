3D Graphics Home Design using Blender for modeling and OpenGL for programming

# Cameron Vaughn
This is one of the first complete projects I've put together. It was designed as a final project in a Computer Graphics course that focused on the OpenGL library with C++ and Blender for the 3D objects.
This course was the first time I used Blender and was mesmerized at its capabilities; I ended up making numerous Blender objects to enhance the project.
